      This is a list of case-insensitive words that do not exist in the dictionary
      but you still want to be considered as recognized by 
      IdentifiersShouldBeSpelledCorrectly. Do not add compound words (e.g. 'FileName') 
      to this list as this will cause CompoundWordsShouldBeBeCasedCorrectly to fire on 
      usages of the compound word stating that they should be changed to their discrete equivalent 
      (for example 'FileName' -> 'Filename').
